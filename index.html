            <strong>Early Life and Education</strong> Walker was born on
            September 12, 1973, in Glendale, California. His mother, Cheryl (née
            Crabtree), was a fashion model, and his father, Paul William Walker
            III, was a sewer contractor and former amateur boxer, who was a
            two-time Golden Gloves champion. Walker's paternal grandfather,
            William, had a short-lived boxing career as "Irish" Billy Walker,
            while another raced factory cars for Ford in the 1960s. Raised as a
            member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Walker
            had four younger siblings: Aimee, Ashlie, Caleb, and Cody. He spent
            the majority of his early life in the Sunland neighborhood of Los
            Angeles, and graduated from Village Christian School in 1991. Walker
            subsequently attended several community colleges in Southern
            California, majoring in marine biology.

            <strong>Career</strong> Walker began a modelling career as a
            toddler, starring in a television commercial for Pampers at age two.
            He continued to appear in commercials, most notably for Showbiz
            Pizza in 1984, before beginning an acting career on television that
            year, appearing in the teen anthology series CBS Schoolbreak
            Special. Walker continued to work in television until 1996, across a
            number of genres; he appeared in two episodes of the fantasy drama
            Highway to Heaven between 1984 and 1986, and secured his first
            leading role in 1987, appearing as Jeremy Beatty in the sitcom
            Throb. He continued to feature on sitcoms in the early 1990s, with
            guest roles in Charles in Charge, Who's the Boss?, and the
            short-lived What a Dummy. In 1993, he portrayed Brandon Collins on
            the soap opera The Young and the Restless; he and co-star Heather
            Tom, who played Victoria Newman, gained fame, and were nominated for
            Outstanding Lead Actor and Actress in a Soap Opera at the Youth in
            Film Awards. Walker's final television role was on Touched by an
            Angel, although he appeared as himself, alongside his sister Ashlie,
            as contestants on a 1988 episode of the game show I'm Telling!, in
            which they finished in second place. Walker began his film career in
            1986, appearing mainly in low budget B films. His first role was in
            the horror comedy Monster in the Closet, and a year later, starred
            in The Retaliator (retroactively subtitled Programmed to Kill), a
            science fiction film. In 1994, he returned to film, starring in
            Tammy and the T-Rex, but secured his first feature film role in the
            comedy Meet the Deedles in 1998; although commercially and
            critically unsuccessful, it allowed Walker to secure supporting
            roles in the films Pleasantville (1998), Varsity Blues (1999), She's
            All That (1999), and The Skulls (2000). After his death in 2013,
            four films starring Walker were released; the thriller film Hours
            (2013), the action film Brick Mansions (2014), itself a remake of
            the French film District 13 (2004). He also served as executive
            producer on the film Pawn Shop Chronicles (2013), while Furious 7,
            originally slated for release in 2014, was pushed back to recreate
            Walker's likeness. The filmmakers hired Peter Jackson's Weta Digital
            visual effects house to complete this, using existing reference
            materials, Walker's brothers Caleb and Cody, as well as actor John
            Brotherton, as stand-ins, and outtakes or older footage, to create
            an accurate remodel of Walker's face. The film was then released in
            2015, and Walker won the award for Choice Movie Actor: Action at the
            2015 Teen Choice Awards, and was nominated for Choice Movie:
            Chemistry (shared with Diesel, Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese
            Gibson, and Ludacris).

            <strong>Personal life</strong> Walker was raised in a Latter-day
            Saint household, but later became a non-denominational Christian. He
            lived in Santa Barbara with his dogs. He and Rebecca Soteros, a
            one-time girlfriend, had a daughter named Meadow Rain Walker, who
            lived with her mother in Hawaii for 13 years and then moved to
            California to live with Walker in 2011.[28] Her godfather is Vin
            Diesel, with whom Walker shared a close bond; Diesel gave him the
            nickname "Pablo", while Walker's mother referred to her son as
            Diesel's "other half". Walker was also close friends with fellow
            Fast & Furious co-star Tyrese Gibson. At the time of his death,
            Walker was in a relationship with Jasmine Pilchard-Gosnell.He held a
            brown belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu under Ricardo "Franjinha" Miller
            at Paragon Jiu-Jitsu and was awarded his black belt by Miller
            posthumously. Walker founded the humanitarian aid nonprofit charity
            Reach Out Worldwide (ROWW) with financial adviser Roger Rodas in
            response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake. He traveled to a number of
            disaster-stricken areas to supply aid until his death. Walker also
            had a large car collection of about 30 cars, a portion of which he
            co-owned along with Rodas. In January 2020, twenty-one vehicles
            owned by Walker were sold for a combined $2.33 million during
            spirited bidding at an annual car auction in Arizona.

            <strong>Death</strong> On November 30, 2013, at about 3:30 p.m. PST,
            Walker, 40, and Roger Rodas, 38, left an event for Walker's charity
            Reach Out Worldwide for victims of Typhoon Haiyan, with Rodas
            driving his 2005 Porsche Carrera GT. Traveling between 80 mph (130
            km/h) and 93 mph (150 km/h) in a 45 mph (72 km/h) speed zone on
            Hercules Street in Valencia, a neighborhood of Santa Clarita,
            California, the car crashed into a concrete lamp post and two trees,
            catching fire. Rodas died of multiple trauma while Walker died from
            the combined effects of trauma and burns. Both of their bodies were
            burned beyond recognition.
